# Deep Neural Network - Fish Weight from Dimensions
I created a deep neural network that will predict the weight of a fish in pounds based on its dimensions.

My program will predict the weight of a fish based on its the vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height, and diagonal width.

Thanks to Khanrad (search Khanrad on YouTube) for helping me getting started on ML in Keras.
