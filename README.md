# Deep Neural Network - Fish Weight from Dimensions
I created a deep neural network that will predict the weight of a fish in pounds based on its dimensions.

My program will predict the weight of a fish based on its the vertical length, diagonal length, cross length, height, and diagonal width. The dataset is small so the accuracy of the prediction varies between models.

I used Khanrad (YouTube)'s tutorial as a starting point for this project.
